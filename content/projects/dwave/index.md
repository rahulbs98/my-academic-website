* Verified the use of DWAVE to achieve a speedup in Machine Learning and combinatorial optimization problems.
* Worked on optimization of various problems - Feature Selection, Quantum Boosting, Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Map Coloring, Satisfiability problem and others using quantum annealing on NASA's DWAVE computer.
* Slides to be updated soon!
