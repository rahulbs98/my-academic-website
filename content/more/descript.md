When I’m not working, I enjoy keeping myself occupied with a lot of side hustles. Over time, I have observed I am doing my work better when I’m also doing other things. I enjoy doodling as I sit in front of my laptop daydreaming. I enjoy dancing, and sharing my mediocre attempts on Instagram. Obviously, I enjoy watching films and TV. It makes me very happy to see that movies like Frozen, Wonder Woman, Raazi and Kahani with strong female leads have also turned out to be amazing commercial successes. One of my goals for 2021 is to learn how to play my Ukulele. I am also looking forward to learning Blender, and annoy my friends with silly animations. ;)

I  enjoy speaking and writing about technology. And I want to take more time out to read and write about technological advancements.
