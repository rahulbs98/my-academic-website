I love reading, and I am trying to build back my habit of reading. While as a teenager I mostly read fiction -  Detective series, Adventure, Romance and Fantasy, I am now trying to diversify my reading list. Of course, Harry Potter stays back, and I will always enjoy re-reading it :P

I am currently reading [Influence, by Robert B. Cialdini](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815.Influence). I found this book in [Tristan Harris's](https://www.tristanharris.com/) recommendations. This is a book on psychology of persuasion, and unlike anything I've read before. While the ideas each chapter in the book start off with very intuitive ideas - things we would normally assume to be true. The surprise (and scary) element of the book lies in how simple methods of persuasion could be used in very crucial situations to bring about positive or disastrous events. It offers insights to how technology is affecting our daily lives, and I would recommend the book to all.

I love reading about new ideas and hearty stories, do share with me if you have some book recommendations. You could also check my reading list, that I'll try to update soon.
