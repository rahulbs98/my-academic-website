I am a final year Computer Science and Physics undergrad at BITS Pilani. I will be joining the engineering team at [Sundial](https://sundial.so/).

I am excited about the field of Artificial Intelligence and Product Development. I have also worked in the intersection of Physics and Computer Science - Quantum Computing, Non Linear Dynamics and Chaos. I'm currently working with [Dr. Franco Nori's](http://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SRUYLREAAAAJ&hl=en) Theoretical Quantum Physics Lab on combinatorial optimization problems with analog computing. This summer, I interned at Google where I worked on multi-modal information extraction. I was also recently at Microsoft Research, where I developed a multi-hop logical NLI dataset with proof steps. We believe this would help build more reliable and interpretable systems, critical in real-world settings.

Please [reach out to me](mailto:f20160471@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in) if you'd like to chat with me!
