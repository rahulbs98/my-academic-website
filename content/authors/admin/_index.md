I am Khyati Jain, a Computer Science and Physics undergrad at BITS Pilani (Goa!). I am excited about learning and developing tech. I am driven to contribute to projects that would be useful and impact as many people as possible. I am currently interning at Microsoft Research, where I am working on multi-hop reasoning with explainable hops. This would help build more reliable and interpretable systems, critical in real-world settings. Recently, I was a summer intern at Google where I worked on multi-modal information extraction. I have also been interested in quantum computing and am looking forward to explore it further.

I am actively looking for full time opportunities in software development starting from Aug '21. Please [reach out to me](mailto:f20160471@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in) if you know of a suitable opportunity!
