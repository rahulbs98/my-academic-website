I am a final year Computer Science and Physics undergrad at BITS Pilani. Upon graduation, I will be joining the engineering team at [Sundial](https://inspirit.work/), an early stage startup working to productise data science as it aligns perfectly with my desire to understand the big picture of the product development cycle.

I have been fortunate to have various opportunities to explore in my undergrad. With my internships at [Google](), where I worked on multimodal-information extraction, and at [Microsoft Research]() where I worked on building a logical NLI dataset, I have developed a keen interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I am particularly interested in the aspects of explainability, interpretability and ethics. I am also excited about other emerging technologies like quantum computing and analog computing. I'm currently writing my thesis with [Dr. Franco Nori's](http://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SRUYLREAAAAJ&hl=en) Lab at RIKEN.

Please [reach out to me](mailto:f20160471@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in) if you'd like to chat with me!
