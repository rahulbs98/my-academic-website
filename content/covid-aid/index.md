As many in the country are struggling to breathe, I have the privilege of the safety of my home and the luxury of being able to work on interesting projects. Throughout my days at BITS I have also significantly benefitted from the community, getting all the advice I needed. Keeping in mind, the disadvantage the current batches faces in access to guidance, I have decided to commit a 45 minute session everyday for the month of May. Ofcourse, based on the response, I'd try to put in more time! Some things I can help you with: **Job applications, Resume reviews, Mock Interviews, Thesis/ Research Internship applications**. I am a Physics + CS final year undergrad from BITS ([know more about me](https://www.khyatijain.com)), so if you're interested in related topics, I'd love to chat with you! In return, I ask you to make a donation to any of the [organisations providing relief](#list) during the pandemic and share the receipt with me.

:star: To chat with me, [Book a slot on my calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UUp5NENDSXRuQVR0fGRlZmF1bHR8ZjI0Yjc4MDk3MThiNDRhZmYyNDJlNjY5ZjQyN2Q2Njg)
When scheduling a call, please also add a short bio about you and what you're expecting. It will help me be prepared and you'll avoid wasting your time.
